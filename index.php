            <h2>Facts</h2>
      <section class="fluid first"><p>Mentoring is often one component of a program that involves other elements, such as tutoring or life skills training and coaching. The supportive, healthy relationships formed between mentors and mentees are both immediate and long-term and contribute to a host of benefits for mentors and mentees.</p></section>
    <section class="fluid second"><p>Mentoring can help youth as they
            go through challenging life transitions, including deal
            ing with stressful changes at home or transitioning t
            o adulthood. Close, healthy, supportive relationships 
            between mentors and mentees that last for a significant
            portion of time (i.e., more than one year) are central
            to success. Without this, mentoring programs run the risk 
            of harming young people who are paired with mentors ill-equipped 
            to meet the mentees' needs. Specifically, relationships with mentors 
            that last less than three months; where there is irregular and 
            inconsistent contact; where there is a disconnect between the personalities, interests, and expectations of the mentors and mentees; where mentors are unprepared and lack skills to relate to youth; and where there is no emotional bond between the mentor and mentee have been found to be harmful to youth (Jekielek et al., 2002; Rhodes & DuBois, 2006).</p></section></article>
